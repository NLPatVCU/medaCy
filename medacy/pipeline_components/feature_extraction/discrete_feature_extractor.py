"""
Extracting training data for use in a CRF.
Features are extracted as discrete dictionaries as described in
`sklearn-crfsuite <https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#features>`_.


These extracted features CANNOT be used in sequence to sequence models expecting continuous inputs (e.g. word vectors).

`sklearn-crfsuite <https://sklearn-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#features>`_ is a wrapper for a C CRF implementation that gives it a sci-kit compatability.
