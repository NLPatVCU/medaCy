"""
Partitions a data set of sequence labels and classifications into 10 stratified folds.
See Dietterich, 1997 "Approximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification
Algorithms" for in-depth analysis.

Each partition should have an evenly distributed representation of sequence labels.
Without stratification, under-representated labels may not appear in some folds.
