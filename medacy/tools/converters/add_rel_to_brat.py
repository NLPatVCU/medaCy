    Given the full paths for an ann file, a rel file, and the txt file that those annotations represent,
    converts the incoming rel data to brat and appends it to the ann file. Input ann file must not contain any
    rel data.

    rel annotations typically refer to entities that have already been annotated. If this is not the case,
    new entities are appended to the ann file. However, the rel format only allows us to determine the character
    spans and entity text and not the entity type. Two parameters exist for this function to specify what those
