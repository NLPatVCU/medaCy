"""
Converts data from con to brat. Enter input and output directories as command line arguments.
Each '.con' file must have a '.txt' file in the same directory with the same name, minus the extension.
Use '-c' (without quotes) as an optional final command-line argument to copy the text files used
in the conversion process to the output directory.

Function 'convert_con_to_brat()' can be imported independently and run on individual files.
