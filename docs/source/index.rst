MedaCy Documentation
====================
For the latest updates, please see the project on `github <https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy>`_.

MedaCy is a medical text mining framework built over spaCy to facilitate the engineering, training and application
of machine learning models for medical information extraction.

To confront the unique challenges posed by medical text
medaCy provides interfaces to medical ontologies such as `Metamap <https://metamap.nlm.nih.gov/>`_ allowing their
integration into text mining workflows. Additional help, examples and tutorials can be found in the examples section
of the `repository <https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy/tree/master/examples>`_.

MedaCy does not officially support non-unix based operating systems (however we have found most functionality works on Windows).

Trained Models
--------------
A complete listing of trained models can be found `here <https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy/tree/master/examples#utilizing-pre-trained-ner-models>`_.


Datasets
--------
MedaCy implements a Dataset functionality that loosely wraps a working directory to manage and version training data.
See more in the `examples <https://github.com/NLPatVCU/medaCy/tree/master/examples>`_.
